        <p id='about-text'>

We’re a group of passionate ladies committed to cultivating positive change - to creating the #Upside where the downside seems vast.</br></br>

Our mission is to educate, inspire, and empower those around us to do the same by uniting the people we care about with the causes that make us passionate.</br></br>

We believe there’s never been a more critical time to consider what we stand for, to assert what we value, and to spark a conversation…. Because positive change requires more than hope. It requires action and maybe a little discomfort.. Bottom line: it’s always worth it.
