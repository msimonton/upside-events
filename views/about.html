We’re a group of passionate ladies committed to cultivating positive change - to creating the #Upside where the downside seems insurmountable.</br></br>

Our mission is to educate, inspire, and empower those around us to do the same by uniting the people we care about with the causes that make us passionate.</br></br>

We believe there’s never been a more critical time to consider what we stand for, to assert what we value, and to spark a conversation…. Because positive change requires more than hope. It requires risk, perseverance, dedication, discomfort and maybe even fear. Bottom line: it’s always worth it.</br></br>

Our Upside Event Series will shed light on various causes – one per quarter – that demand our passion.</br></br>

Each event will focus on a specific charity or a group that aligns with a need we feel is crucial. By inviting our network to learn about and contribute to these causes, our hope is that we ignite the desire in our attendees to pursue the causes that resonate with them personally. The first events are set, but we’ll rely on our network to share their passions with us as time goes on, and to inform the causes to illuminate for future events.</p>
